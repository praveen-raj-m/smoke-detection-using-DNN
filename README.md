# SMOKE-detection-using-DNN

## Overview

This repository contains the necessary files and instructions for deploying a smoke detection model based on the VGG16 architecture. The model has been trained on a dataset of 6000 images in TIFF format.

## Model Architecture

The VGG16 model achieved an accuracy of 86.27%, outperforming the ResNet50V2 model (84.34%) in terms of accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing consists of 6000 images in TIFF format. Ensure that the dataset is organized with appropriate folders for training and testing, following the directory structure:
